# RULES FOR PULL/MERGE REQUEST:
__ __

HERE‚ÄôS HOW WE VALIDATE CONTRIBUTOR PULL/MERGE REQUESTS (‚ÄúPR/MRS‚Äù) FOR HACKTOBERFEST

### **[CONSIDERED OUT-OF-BOUND]**
YOUR PR/MRS MUST BE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF HACKTOBERFEST.
~~~
Your PR/MRs must be created between October 1 and October 31 (in any time zone, UTC-12 thru UTC+14).

Your PR/MRs must be made to a public, unarchived repository.
~~~
### **[SPAM]**
YOUR PR/MRS MUST NOT BE SPAMMY
~~~
PR/MRs that are labeled with a label containing the word ‚Äúspam‚Äù by maintainers will not be counted.

We use the Node.js 16 RegEx engine with /\bspam\b/i to look for spam labels.

PR/MRs that also have the ‚Äúhacktoberfest-accepted‚Äù label cannot be marked as spammy via a label.

PR/MRs that have been merged and do not have a label containing the word ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù cannot be marked as spammy via a label.

PR/MRs that our system detects as spammy will also not be counted.

Any user with two or more spammy PR/MRs will be disqualified.
~~~
### **[INVALID]**
YOUR PR/MRS MUST NOT BE LABELED AS ‚ÄúINVALID‚Äù
~~~
PR/MRs that have a label containing the word ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù won‚Äôt be counted, unless they also have the ‚Äúhacktoberfest-accepted‚Äù label.

Specifically, we use the Node.js 16 RegEx engine with /\binvalid\b/i to look for invalid labels.
~~~
### **[ACCEPTED]**
YOUR PR/MRS MUST BE MERGED, HAVE THE ‚ÄúHACKTOBERFEST-ACCEPTED‚Äù LABEL, OR HAVE AN OVERALL APPROVING REVIEW.
~~~
Your PR/MR must not be a draft to be considered accepted.

If your PR/MR is being accepted for Hacktoberfest via an overall approving review it must also not be closed.
~~~
### **[PR/MRS APPROVING BY HACKTOBERFEST]**
ONCE YOUR PR/MRS PASS ALL THE CHECKS ABOVE, IT WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR HACKTOBERFEST AFTER THE 7-DAY REVIEW PERIOD
~~~
We continually evaluate all of the checks except the [PARTICIPATING] check. If it fails any of these checks during this time, the 7-day timer will reset.

After the 7-day review period completes, your PR/MR will be automatically accepted for Hacktoberfest assuming it still passes all the checks. Once accepted for Hacktoberfest, we stop checking. :party:
~~~



```py
Always make more then 4 pull requests.
Lets say you have made only 4 pull request to different projects,
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 
then you have remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects is not excluded.
If you fail to make 4 pull requests then you can't get swags or t-shirts.
I will recommend you to make pull request to your own repo which is very very safest side for you..
keep in mind that repo has hacktoberfest topic..
